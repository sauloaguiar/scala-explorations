## Scala Explorations

I am studying functional programming implementations and trying to get a
bit more comfortable with the functional and specially the recursive way of thinking.
I follow this [StackOverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772631/small-and-good-scala-projects-to-learn-scala-especially-functional-programmin)
and found the [99 Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) page.

In this repository you will find my solutions to these problems.
